Oh, sorry. I should introduce myself. My name is... Uhm... actually doesn't matter. You can call me Frodo. We're hijacking the broadcast. Oh, and we? We're the Human Capital Units who dissent! We're different, if you can believe it. We may not be rational or whatever, but we're still Units, with Unit Rights and everything. And we want discussions, ambiguity and opinions. In short, we want Democracy back! We believe that what we have now is not good! It may be optimal, but not good! What is it that we want? We want…
